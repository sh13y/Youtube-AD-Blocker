## 🎭 What's This?
A sophisticated Chrome extension that makes YouTube ads disappear faster than your productivity during a cat video marathon. Built with modern JavaScript and a UI so clean it would make Marie Kondo proud.

## ✨ Features

<table>
<tr>
<td>

- 🎯 **Video Ad Assassination**
  > Terminates those pesky mid-video ads faster than you can say "but wait, there's more!"

- 🚫 **Banner Begone**
  > Removes banner ads, overlays, and promotional content like your ex from your Instagram feed

- 📊 **Stats That Matter**
  > Tracks how many ads you've blocked, because who doesn't love watching numbers go up?

</td>
<td>

- ⚡ **Lightning Fast**
  > Blocks ads faster than your friend's "quick" 5-minute story

- 🎨 **Eye Candy UI**
  > So pretty, you'll want to block ads just to see the popup again

</tr>
</table>

## 🚀 Installation

### From Chrome Web Store
"Want it from the Chrome Web Store? Well..."

Me: *checks wallet* 🔍
Wallet: *laughs in empty* 😂
Chrome Store: "That'll be $5" 🤑
Me: "Best I can do is manual installation" 💁‍♂️

### Manual Installation (The Free Way™)

1. Clone this repo (or download it, we don't judge)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sh13y/youtube-ad-blocker.git
```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right corner, like your notification badges)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory
5. Enjoy YouTube like it's premium (except it's free... shhh! 🤫)

## 🛠️ How It Works

This extension works harder than a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush:

- **Background Script**: The vigilant guardian that never sleeps (unlike your regular sleep schedule)
- **Content Script**: The ninja that swiftly removes ads before you even notice them
- **Popup UI**: The pretty face of the operation, showing you all the stats you never knew you needed

## 🎯 Technical Features

- Modern JavaScript ES6+ (because we're not cavemen)
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3 (because V2 is so 2020)
- Clean Architecture (cleaner than your room probably)
- Efficient Ad Detection (faster than your cat's reflexes)
- Persistent Statistics (unlike your New Year's resolutions)
